The goal of trackpack is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of trackpack like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(trackpack)
## basic example code
library(ggplot2)
library(cranlogs)
stats <- cran_downloads("lazytrade", from=Sys.Date() - 100, to=Sys.Date()-1)
ggplot(stats, aes(date, count)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title=sprintf(
      "{stats} downloads to %s",
      Sys.Date() - 1
    ),
    caption = "dat from {cranlogs}"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
